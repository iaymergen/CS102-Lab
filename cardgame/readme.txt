CS102 - CardGame homework
=========================
Fall 2020 

This folder contains all the classes for the card game we designed in lectures.
It also contains a DrJava project file. 
If you are using a different IDE, simply copy the .java files as necessary.

You can find the lecture slides with the design in Moodle. 

Your task is to complete the game. First make sure the project compiles
and the CardGameTest class runs (ignore MyCardGame until everything else is working). 
Take a look at each of the Java classes, see how they correspond to the design. 
You will see many methods are left for you "ToDo" -- that's your homework!

This is a graded homework and must be done individually. 
Upload your solution to the moodle homework activity for your section 
by the specified due date with the usual filename format, "SS_HW2_yourname.zip".

If you have any questions related to this homework, please ask on the course forum.

good luck,

Ozcan.
